# Logs Analysis Project
This project aims to provide practice interacting with a live database with over a million rows. By exploring the database, we are tasked to build and refine complex queries and use them to draw business conclusions from data.

## Questions:
1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?
