# Logs Analysis Project
This project aims to provide practice interacting with a live database both from the command line and through written code. The project allows you to explore a large database with over a million rows. My code aims to build and refine complex queries and use them to draw business conclusions from data.

###Questions:
1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?
